# Server Go (`apps/server-go`)

> Status: **PLACEHOLDER**.

This directory is reserved for future Go server work and currently contains no active runtime code.

## Notes for AI Agents

- Do not implement new production features here by default.
- Prefer existing active modules:
  - `apps/api` for current backend API work
  - `packages/daemon` for Go sandbox daemon work
- If activation is required, update `.x/module-status.md` first.
